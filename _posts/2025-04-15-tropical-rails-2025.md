I had the pleasure of attending the [Tropical on Rails 2025](https://tropicalonrails.com/) conference in São Paulo, Brazil, on April 03 and 04, 2025. It was a fantastic experience!
The event was organized by [Cirdes Henrique](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cirdeshenrique/) and his team, who did an amazing job bringing together a diverse group of speakers and attendees from around the world.

Two full days of keynotes, talks, and in-depth discussions on the key technical and business challenges facing the Ruby on Rails ecosystem and the wider tech industry. Topics included LLM integration, cloud costs and deployment, asynchronous job testing, and more.

Great to connect and learn from experts and major players from Brazil, the USA, Canada, Mexico, Georgia, Spain, and beyond.

Impeccable organization in every detail. Thanks to Cirdes and everyone who made these two days a fantastic experience for networking, learning, and even some enjoyment!

In the next weeks the videos of the talks will be available on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@tropicalonrails) of the event. I highly recommend checking them out!
