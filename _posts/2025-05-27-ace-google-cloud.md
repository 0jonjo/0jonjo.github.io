After three months of classes, exercises, and practical labs, I'm excited to announce that I passed the exam and am now certified as an [Associate Cloud Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-engineer) by Google Cloud!

A few months ago, I enrolled in the Get Certified 2025 program. It's an excellent program that offers free credits for Qwiklabs, live synchronous classes, study groups, and practical exercises, all designed to prepare you for the certification exam. The instructors are incredibly knowledgeable, and the content is well-structured. Special shout-out to [Arki1](<https://www.linkedin.com/company/arki1>), their partner responsible for support, who specializes in cloud computing training.

I particularly enjoyed the blend of theory and hands-on practice. All exercises used real tools in [Google Cloud accounts](https://cloud.google.com/) with costs fully covered by Google. This was a fantastic opportunity to learn and practice cloud computing concepts in a truly hands-on way, especially for me with Kubernetes, deployments, load balancing, and networking.

If you're interested in cloud technology and considering getting certified, I highly recommend checking out the [Get Certified program](https://cloud.google.com/innovators/getcertified). It's a superb way to learn and prepare for the certification exam (FOR FREE!), with the added benefit of experienced instructors and a supportive community of learners.
