I've released version 1.4.0 of Calcpace!

This version introduces new possibilities for distance and speed calculations, including average speed, pace, total time, and predicted distance. It also features a conversion tool with options for international, nautical, and imperial standards.

You can calculate using three kinds of methods:

- **Without checks**: Fastest, using float or integers.
- **With checks**: Fast, using float/integers and clocktime (HH:MM:SS).
- **With clocktime return**: Slowest.

Calcpace supports different check methods for each calculation and offers 26 types of conversions between distances and speeds. See the table below for the new conversion options:

| Conversion Unit      | Description                  |

| `:km_to_mi`          | Kilometers to Miles          |
