Years ago, as I embarked on the code world, I created a simple calculator to determine distance, time, and pace – essential tools for any runner. A few months later, I expanded this idea into my first Ruby gem: Calcpace. This tool is useful not only for running/cycling calculate, it offers precise, lightning-fast calculations for time, distance, and pace, supporting two measurement units (kilometers or miles) and other interesting options (like BigDecimal).

Beyond general proposes calculations, this gem can convert distances and format time in different ways. I'll dive deeper into the technical details and design decisions behind this lib in a future post, drawing on my experience in large-scale logistics applications.

Today, I’m thrilled to celebrate a significant milestone: Calcpace has been used by over 800 developers! Thank you to everyone who has embraced this tool!

This gem is available on RubyGems and GitHub. You can find documentation, examples and how to use it at the following links. Check it out!
