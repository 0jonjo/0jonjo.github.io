I'm currently working on implementing a RabbitMQ consumer and wanted to revisit and solidify my understanding. As a popular open-source message broker, it excels in microservice architectures, event-driven architectures, and fault-tolerant systems.

To refresh my grasp on core concepts, I found a great article that dig into the fundamentals: queue and message attributes, exchange types, and architectural patterns. It finishes with a practical example using Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Docker, and the Bunny gem, complete with a link to the GitHub repo.

This seems like an excellent introduction for anyone wanting to learn RabbitMQ's core concepts and how to use it with Rails.

Here's the article link: [https://mateo-mojica.medium.com/how-to-use-rabbitmq-with-rails-4771d29d725b](https://mateo-mojica.medium.com/how-to-use-rabbitmq-with-rails-4771d29d725b)

Here is the official RabbitMQ tutorials and docs: [https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials)
