Recently, a buddy shared with me a really cool video about queues. My friend, [Brenno Costa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brennovich/) - a experienced and skilled software engineer -, generally shares interesting and relevant content. In this case, it tackled the concept of queues, diving into the differences types and comparisons between them in dropped requests, time outs and wait time.

The video explores an awesome interactive website called [Queueing](https://encore.dev/blog/queueing) by Sam Rose. This site is basically a playground for studying queueing strategies. You get to play with balls in various queue types, seeing how each one behaves in action. You'll get hands-on with three main queue types: `FIFO`, `LIFO` and `Priorities`. By the end, you'll have a solid grasp of how they compare in different request scenarios, giving you an understanding of active queue management.

A really interesting and interactive way to learn about queues. I highly recommend checking out the video and messing around on the website!
